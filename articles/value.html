        <h1>Understanding Estimated Value</h1>

                Commonly, when I get together with friends to watch a sports game, almost always, the first question asked is “what bets do you have for tonight's game?” Sports betting has grown into a billion-dollar industry, attracting millions of casual bettors whose egos assume their sports knowledge can become a profitable venture. For the average bettor, sportsbooks present an enticing place that invites big payouts; However, the reality is that sportsbooks operate with calculated precision, exploiting edges most people do not understand. From estimated value principles to dopamine addiction and the allure of turning your hourly wage into a month's pay, sportsbooks have fine-tuned their model to ensure they come out ahead in the long run.

                There are very few bettors that have sustained profitable results over a long period. Let's conceptualize why. What if I offered you a fair-sided coin and asked you to bet $100 on one flip? You may not take the bet; however, humor me for a second and take the chance. Odds are if you called the side correctly, you would expect to profit $100 from the $100 you wagered. Now, what if I said that I’ll offer you another coin flip bet; however, this time (if you win) I'll pay you $90 instead of $100. You would probably shake your head and tell me to get lost. How come sports bettors don't tell the sportsbooks the exact same thing? This second scenario highlights the edge that sportsbooks take on every single game. The more times you repeat the event with a $90 dollar reward, the more times (above 50%) you would have to guess the correct side on the fair-sided coin. While it's possible, it's extremely difficult, as the probability of an event will reach its theoretical likeness the more times it occurs. This bet is a complete sucker's bet, as you would have to correctly guess the fair-sided coin (approximately 53% or more) to profit.

                What is the estimated value and American odds? Estimated value is a concept intended to denote the estimated return of an investment at some point in the future. The formula is as follows: Expected Value (EV)= (Win Probability × Win Amount) + (Lose Probability × Lose Amount). Using the coin example with this formula: (0.50 x 90) + (0.50 x -100) A return of $-5 is on average the expected return. Meaning every time you place this bet you are theoretically losing $5. Sportsbooks are meticulous in setting lines to ensure that most bets offer negative EV for bettors. Using advanced algorithms, historical data, and statistical models, they create odds that account for the likelihood of an event while skewing them slightly to ensure profitability. In American odds, “-110” is a common bet line used for 50/50 games. The -110 informs the better: if you want to profit $100 dollars you must wager $110… -500 odds means to profit $100 you must wager $500 (-500 used in scenarios where one team is a massive favorite). You can now see why betting through the sportsbook is a sucker bet. With this knowledge, you hopefully wouldn't take my coin flip bet from earlier, but what if we look at parlays?

                Among the many offerings in a sportsbook, parlays stand out as the ultimate trap for the average bettor. A parlay combines multiple bets into one wager, with the condition that all bets picked must win for the bettor to win a multiplied payout. While parlays promise higher payouts, they significantly increase the house edge; For example, assuming a straight bet that's 50/50 offers -110 (the casino's edge) and that event is parlayed with two other events with similar lines and probability. The three-leg parlay with each leg at -110 offers +595 odds. This means 100 dollars on those three legs offers $595 in profit. Sounds great, but is it? This three-leg parlay has a success rate of (0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5) = 12.5%, or in other terms ⅛ chance you win. Using our formula from earlier (0.125 x 595) + (0.875 x −100) = $-13.125 in theory every time the parlay is placed. To summarize, you can't achieve multiplied payouts without the casino edge being multiplied as well.

                    Sportsbooks tap into the human brain's reward system. Every placed bet, near-miss, or big win triggers a release of dopamine, the chemical associated with pleasure and reward. This creates a feedback loop that keeps bettors coming back for more. Ironically, losses contribute to this addiction. The concept of "chasing losses" is rooted in the gambler's fallacy – the belief that a win is due after a series of losses. Sportsbooks leverage this by offering enticing bonuses, promotions, and "risk-free" bets that keep bettors engaged even after significant losses. In-game betting and mobile apps amplify this dopamine cycle by providing instant gratification. Bettors can wager on minute-by-minute outcomes, keeping their brains constantly stimulated. This cycle often blinds bettors to their long-term losses, as the short-term wins never illustrate the true negative estimated value the bettors are being offered. This is usually caused by the gratification of a win that undermines the implied odds. It's not until the bettors look at their multi-year net performance, where they start to realize the total net loss. This is typically a collection of their implied negative odds added together over the time period in question.

                    To avoid falling into the sportsbook's trap, bettors need to approach sports betting with discipline and an understanding of its underlying principles. This starts with acknowledging that sportsbooks are not in the business of losing money; while hidden, their edge is carefully calculated and relatively large. Although rare, strategies such as focusing on straight bets with positive EV lines are essential to success. Managing bankrolls and avoiding emotional bets can also help mitigate losses. Ultimately, for the "common Joe," sports betting should be viewed as a quick dopamine rush with a price tag, recognizing that just because their favorite team is playing, or a certain opponent is injured, does not mean they‘ve outsmarted the book, as these algorithms offer odds that have already factored in news, statistics, and bettors sentiment in real-time.
