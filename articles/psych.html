                Venture capital has a notorious habit of picking hundreds of companies to invest in expecting the best-performing few to return enough to fulfill the company's hurdle return. From 2004-2014, 65% of venture financings lost money, two and a half percent gained 10x-20x, one percent returned more than 20x-50x, and half a percent had returns exceeding 50x. What if I said the Russell 3000 followed a similar trend? The Russell 3000 is a broad-market index that represents the largest 3,000 publicly traded companies in the U.S. by market cap. This is deemed as a benchmark index fund, (similar to the S&P 500) it represents the broad market quite accurately. J.P. Morgan Asset Management released the distribution of returns for the Russell 3000. Over the measured period forty percent of companies lost 70% or greater and never recovered. Effectively, all of the index’s overall returns came from the top 7% of companies that outperformed the market by at least two standard deviations.

                Decentralization: Decentralization refers to the distribution of control and decision-making power across a network (think a system of users) rather than concentrating it in a single entity or small group. Decentralized systems ensure that no single participant can unilaterally manipulate the system for any motive; ultimately, decentralization ensures trust amongst users and eliminates the risk of ignorant, abusive, or mishandled powers, to the projects, currencies, or developments that a blockchain intends to upholds; For example, there is not a single country around the world that possesses a fully decentralized monetary system; Hence, it is a driver of Bitcoin’s uniqueness, as it is not controlled by a single entity. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known blockchain, exemplifies decentralization, as its proof-of-work consensus mechanism allows thousands of nodes worldwide to participate in verifying transactions, distributing verification of the ledger recordings amongst its community of anonymous users. With pros come cons, broad participation requires significant computational resources illustrating the first trade-off – scalability, What do I mean by scalability? I mean the multiple dimensions that define how well a network can handle more users, typically measured in latency, transactions per second, and the cost or fee required to complete it. This trade-off demonstrates the difficulty of maintaining decentralization while improving transaction throughput, typically an inverse relationship in reference to Bitcoin, as solving scalability challenges would require reducing the number of participating nodes or simplifying consensus mechanisms – ultimately centralizing power to a smaller group of nodes.

                Security: Since its inception, Bitcoin has never had a fraudulent transaction on the blockchain. Security ensures that a blockchain is resistant to attacks, fraud, and unauthorized access. A secure blockchain maintains the integrity of its data and operations, protecting users from malicious actors. A blockchain’s security depends on its consensus mechanism and the number of resources, points of attack, energy, and the computing power required to compromise it. Unlike centralized systems, with Bitcoin, there is no single group, server, or person that can be targeted. Even if some nodes are compromised, the remaining nodes will reject invalid or fraudulent blocks, preserving the integrity and accuracy of the network. The emphasis on security and decentralization, creates a constraint on scalability as mentioned earlier, as the joint computational effort of nodes required for each transaction limits the network’s capacity.

                Scalability: Scalability refers to a blockchain’s ability to handle a growing number of transactions and users without compromising performance. As blockchain adoption increases, so does the demand for faster and more efficient networks. Unfortunately, the inherent design of Bitcoin’s blockchain makes scalability a challenge. Bitcoin, for instance, processes only 7 transactions per second, while traditional (non blockchain) payment networks like Visa handle thousands, making it less viable as a daily transaction medium, and more intrinsically valued because of its finite properties similar to gold. Back to the Visa example: Visa is centralized, because of its value of scalability meaning it is susceptible to outages, hacks, or shutdowns. Visa for example, can process tens of thousands of transactions a second. If Visa's servers are compromised or the company faces legal or political pressure, the entire network could be disrupted. Bitcoin is not susceptible to any of these risks.

                    The Blockchain Trilemma remains a core challenge in the development of decentralized technologies. Balancing scalability, security, and decentralization is complex, as improving one aspect often compromises the others. Alternatives have arisen in recent years, typically offering strengths in 1-2 of the other areas where another (say Bitcoin) may lack. Coins like Solana master areas like scalability allowing 65,000 transactions per second, an area Bitcoin seems to struggle. Ethereum's security has dramatically improved through its robust smart contract platform and its recent transition to Proof-of-Stake. Polkadot excels in decentralization through its unique architecture, enabling synergy between multiple blockchains (called parachains). Its decentralized governance model allows token holders to participate in decision-making processes, ensuring the network's evolution remains democratic. While the Blockchain Trilemma may never be resolved, innovative projects are helping to narrow the gap and expand the potential use of blockchain systems. Alternatives to central authorities continue to thrive around the world, so It's a priority of mine to understand what gives them value, what constrains them, and if they are viable investments for the future.
